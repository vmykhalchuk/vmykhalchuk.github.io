Types of pieces of information:
 - link
 - todo item (text note)
 - idea (text notes)
 - idea (picture)
 - browser search page
 - file (any from pc)
 - contact

Grouping of those pieces of information:
 - Parent-Child relation (no graph needed)
 - references to other nodes (kinda graph but limited)
 -

Additional data linked to the piece of information:
 - time+location (system + user defined)
 - description
 - tags
 - secure type (open data, sensitive, critical, etc.)
 - how to inherit above data (down to children / get from parent, no inheritance, partial inheritance, etc.)

- Security Aspect
  - some data read-only or not even viewable (depending on user access)

Additional ideas:
 - heatmap of visits/edits -
 - security aspect (read-only, not-visible, only data not visible (key visible but data masked))

Questions to investigate deeper:
 - alternative solutions to this system
 - how to secure information



Event driven:
 - try to discover if will work without proper syncrhonization
  - possible operations:
    - add child (to parent_id after child_id (-1 - if first, -2 if there were no children, -3 if last after all children))
    - delete node
    - change node name
    - change node attribute
    - move node to another parent
