*** Intro ***
This tool is used to organize and store all my knowledge and ideas in tree structure with
  extensive links between nodes and calculating formulas (similar to spreadsheets)
  
*** Supported functions ***
* sumcount - counts leaf nodes and summarizes below nodes
* sumsum - summarizes leaf node values and then summarizes below nodes
* ref - gets value of another node's value
* linksubnodes - links sub-nodes of the node to current node (adding sub-node to current node will add it to the linked node instead)
